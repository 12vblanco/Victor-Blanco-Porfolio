    text: "The Orchard Bar in Canonmills, Edinburgh, has been a long-standing client of mine, for whom I continue to manage and update their website. They initially approached me to revitalise their online presence with a sleeker, more sophisticated design, specifically requesting the addition of a gallery and a direct table reservation system. They granted me complete creative freedom from the outset, and I deployed their site using React, while still undertaking periodic maintenance and updates.",

With a background in art and a longstanding interest in digital design, my university degree has allowed me to gain thorough knowledge of conceptualising features with a user-centric approach. I have become proficient in UX design, a task I find immensely satisfying. An example of this is one of the prototypes I developed for university, which earned me high grades and personal fulfilment.",
